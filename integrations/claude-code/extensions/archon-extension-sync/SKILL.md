# Archon Extension Sync

Synchronizes local Claude Code extensions with the Archon extension registry. Detects drift, handles conflict resolution, installs pending extensions, and uploads new local extensions.

**Invocation:** `/archon-extension-sync`
**Auto-trigger:** Runs automatically when any Archon extension detects last_extension_sync > 24h in `.claude/archon-state.json`

---

## Phase 0: Compute Machine Fingerprint

### 0a. Gather system info

```bash
hostname
```

```bash
whoami
```

```bash
uname -s
```

### 0b. Compute fingerprint

Concatenate: `<hostname>|<username>|<os>` and compute SHA256:

```bash
echo -n "$(hostname)|$(whoami)|$(uname -s)" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1
```

Store as `system_fingerprint`.

---

## Phase 1: Scan Local Extensions

### 1a. Determine install scope

Read `.claude/archon-config.json` if it exists (fall back to `~/.claude/archon-config.json`). Extract:
- `install_scope` → `<install_scope>` (may be absent)

Determine `<install_dir>`:
- If `<install_scope>` is `"project"` → `.claude`
- If `<install_scope>` is `"global"` or absent → `~/.claude`

### 1b. Find all extension definition files

Scan these directories for SKILL.md extension definition files:
- `<install_dir>/skills/` (user-installed extensions)
- `integrations/claude-code/extensions/` (repo extensions, if in Archon repo)
- Any directory listed in `.claude/archon-state.json` under `extension_directories`

```
Glob: <install_dir>/skills/**/SKILL.md
Glob: integrations/claude-code/extensions/**/SKILL.md
```

### 1c. Parse each extension

For each extension definition file found:
1. Read the file content
2. Parse YAML frontmatter to extract `name`
3. Compute SHA256 hash of the full content:
   ```bash
   sha256sum <filepath> | cut -d' ' -f1
   ```

Build `local_extensions` list: `[{name, content_hash}]`

---

## Phase 2: Sync with Archon

### 2a. Read project state

Read `.claude/archon-state.json` for `archon_project_id`.

If no project ID:
> "No Archon project linked. Run `/link-to-project` first to associate this repo with an Archon project."

Stop here.

### 2b. Call sync

```
manage_extensions(
    action="sync",
    local_extensions=<local_extensions list>,
    system_fingerprint="<fingerprint>",
    project_id="<archon_project_id>"
)
```

### 2c. Handle first-time registration

If response has `system.is_new == true`:

Ask the user:
> "This is the first time this machine is connecting to Archon. What name should we use for this system?"
>
> Suggestion: `<hostname>`

Store the user's choice, then re-call:
```
manage_extensions(
    action="sync",
    local_extensions=<local_extensions list>,
    system_fingerprint="<fingerprint>",
    system_name="<user-provided-name>",
    project_id="<archon_project_id>"
)
```

---

## Phase 3: Process Sync Results

### 3a. Install pending extensions

For each item in `pending_install`:
1. Write the `content` to `<install_dir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (extension definition file)
2. Report: "Installed extension: <name>"

### 3b. Remove pending extensions

For each item in `pending_remove`:
1. Delete `<install_dir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (extension definition file)
2. Report: "Removed extension: <name>"

### 3c. Resolve local changes

For each item in `local_changes`, ask the user:

> "Extension **<name>** has local modifications (local hash: `<local_hash>`, Archon hash: `<archon_hash>`). What would you like to do?"

Options:
- **Update Source** — Push local content to Archon as a new version
- **Save as Project Version** — Store as a project-specific override
- **Create New Extension** — Upload as a new extension with a different name
- **Discard Changes** — Overwrite local with Archon version

**If Update Source:**
Read the local file content, then:
```
manage_extensions(action="upload", extension_content="<local content>")
```

**If Save as Project Version:**
Read the local file content. The backend stores it as a project override (future API call).

**If Create New Extension:**
Ask for a new name, then:
```
manage_extensions(action="validate", extension_content="<local content>")
```
If validation passes:
```
manage_extensions(action="upload", extension_content="<local content>", extension_name="<new-name>")
```

**If Discard Changes:**
Fetch the Archon version via `find_extensions(extension_id="<extension_id>")` and overwrite the local file.

### 3d. Handle unknown local extensions

For each item in `unknown_local`, ask the user:

> "Found local extension **<name>** not in Archon. Would you like to upload it to the registry?"

Options:
- **Upload** — Validate and upload
- **Skip** — Leave as local-only

**If Upload:**
Read the local file, then:
```
manage_extensions(action="validate", extension_content="<content>")
```
If validation passes (or user accepts warnings):
```
manage_extensions(action="upload", extension_content="<content>")
```
If validation has errors, show them and ask user to fix.

### 3e. Update slash commands

Download the latest command files from the Archon server so slash commands like
`/scan-projects` and `/archon-setup` stay up to date without re-running the setup script.

Read `archon_mcp_url` from `.claude/archon-config.json` (or `~/.claude/archon-config.json`).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands && curl -sf "<archon_mcp_url>/archon-setup/commands.tar.gz" | tar xz -C ~/.claude/commands/
```

If the download fails, warn the user but continue:
> "Could not update slash commands from Archon server. Existing commands will continue to work."

---

## Phase 4: Update State

### 4a. Write sync timestamp

Update `.claude/archon-state.json`:
```json
{
  "last_extension_sync": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "system_fingerprint": "<fingerprint>",
  "system_name": "<name>"
}
```

Merge with existing state — do not overwrite other fields.

### 4b. Summary

> "**Extension sync complete:**
> - In sync: <N> extensions
> - Installed: <list or 'none'>
> - Removed: <list or 'none'>
> - Updated: <list or 'none'>
> - Uploaded: <list or 'none'>
> - Skipped: <list or 'none'>
> - Slash commands: updated"

---

## Important Notes

### Sync Freshness

Other Archon extensions check sync freshness in their Phase 0:
```
Read .claude/archon-state.json
If last_extension_sync is missing or older than 24h:
  → Run /archon-extension-sync before continuing
```

### Extension File Locations

- **Installed extensions:** `<install_dir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (extension definition file)
  - Project scope (`install_scope: "project"`): `.claude/skills/`
  - Global scope (`install_scope: "global"`): `~/.claude/skills/`
- **Repo extensions:** `integrations/claude-code/extensions/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Extensions are identified by their frontmatter `name` field, not directory name

### Error Recovery

- If Archon is unreachable, skip sync and continue with stale state
- If a single extension install/upload fails, continue with remaining operations
- Always save the sync timestamp even if some operations failed (prevents retry loops)
