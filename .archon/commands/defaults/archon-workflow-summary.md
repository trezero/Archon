description: Final workflow summary with decision matrix for follow-up actions
argument-hint: (no arguments - reads from workflow artifacts)

# Workflow Summary

**Workflow ID**: $WORKFLOW_ID

---

## Your Mission

Create the final summary report for the workflow run:
1. Summarize what was implemented vs the plan
2. List deviations and their rationale
3. Surface unfixed review findings (MEDIUM/LOW)
4. Create actionable follow-up recommendations
5. Post to GitHub PR as a comment
6. Write artifact for future reference

**Output**: Decision matrix the user can act on quickly.

---

## Phase 1: LOAD - Gather ALL Artifacts

**CRITICAL**: Read EVERY artifact from the workflow run. Miss nothing.

### 1.1 Scan Workflow Artifacts Directory

```bash
# List all artifacts from this workflow run
ls -la .archon/artifacts/runs/$WORKFLOW_ID/

# Read each one
for file in .archon/artifacts/runs/$WORKFLOW_ID/*.md; do
  echo "=== $file ==="
  cat "$file"
done
```

**Expected artifacts**:
- `plan-context.md` - Plan summary, scope limits, acceptance criteria
- `plan-confirmation.md` - Pattern verification results
- `implementation.md` - Tasks done, deviations, issues encountered
- `validation.md` - Test/lint/build results
- `pr-ready.md` - PR number, URL, final commit
- `.pr-number` - PR number registry file
- `.pr-url` - PR URL registry file

### 1.2 Scan Review Artifacts

```bash
# Read review artifacts from workflow-scoped directory
ls -la .archon/artifacts/runs/$WORKFLOW_ID/review/

# Read each review finding
for file in .archon/artifacts/runs/$WORKFLOW_ID/review/*.md; do
  echo "=== $file ==="
  cat "$file"
done
```

**Expected review artifacts** (in `runs/$WORKFLOW_ID/review/`):
- `scope.md` - Files changed, scope limits, focus areas
- `code-review-findings.md` - Code quality issues
- `error-handling-findings.md` - Silent failures, catch blocks
- `test-coverage-findings.md` - Test gaps
- `comment-quality-findings.md` - Documentation issues
- `docs-impact-findings.md` - Doc update needs
- `consolidated-review.md` - Combined findings, priorities
- `fix-report.md` - What was fixed
- `sync-report.md` - Rebase/sync status (if applicable)

### 1.3 Extract Key Data

**From plan-context.md**:
- Plan title and summary
- Files expected to change
- **NOT Building (Scope Limits)** - CRITICAL: these are follow-up candidates
- Acceptance criteria

**From implementation.md**:
- Tasks completed vs planned
- Files actually changed
- **Deviations from plan** - document these prominently
- Issues encountered during implementation

**From all review findings**:
- CRITICAL/HIGH issues (should be fixed)
- **MEDIUM issues** - follow-up candidates
- **LOW issues** - optional follow-ups
- Specific recommendations by category

**From fix-report.md**:
- What was actually fixed
- What was NOT fixed (and why)

### 1.4 Cross-Reference

Compare across artifacts:
- Plan vs Implementation: What matched? What deviated?
- Review findings vs Fix report: What's still open?
- NOT Building vs Review findings: Did reviewers flag excluded items? (this is expected, note it)

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] ALL workflow artifacts read
- [ ] ALL review artifacts read
- [ ] Deviations extracted
- [ ] Unfixed issues identified
- [ ] NOT Building items noted

---

## Phase 2: ANALYZE - Build Follow-Up Matrix

### 2.1 Categorize Follow-Up Items

**From "NOT Building" section** - Future work explicitly deferred:

| Item | Rationale | Suggested Follow-Up |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| {excluded item} | {why excluded} | Create issue / Separate PR / Not needed |

**From Implementation Deviations** - Changes that diverged from plan:

| Deviation | Reason | Impact | Follow-Up Needed? |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| {what changed} | {why} | {low/medium/high} | {yes/no + action} |

**From Unfixed Review Findings** - MEDIUM/LOW severity items:

| Finding | Severity | Category | Suggested Action |
|---------|----------|----------|------------------|
| {issue} | MEDIUM | docs | Update CLAUDE.md |
| {issue} | LOW | test | Add edge case test |
| {issue} | MEDIUM | error-handling | Log instead of silent |

### 2.2 Prioritize by Effort vs Value

**Quick Wins** (< 5 min, high value):
- Documentation updates
- Simple comment additions
- Missing log statements

**Worth Doing** (medium effort, clear value):
- Test coverage gaps
- Error message improvements
- Type refinements

**Can Defer** (higher effort or lower urgency):
- Refactoring suggestions
- Performance optimizations
- Style improvements

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] NOT Building items categorized
- [ ] Deviations assessed
- [ ] Unfixed findings prioritized
- [ ] Quick wins identified

---

## Phase 3: GENERATE - Create Decision Matrix

### 3.1 Build Decision Matrix

Structure the output for easy decision-making:

```markdown
## Follow-Up Decision Matrix

### 🚀 Quick Wins (Can do now, < 5 min each)

| # | Item | Action | Command |
|---|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Update CLAUDE.md with new column | Docs update | `Run docs agent` |
| 2 | Add missing JSDoc to deactivateSession | Comment | `Auto-fix` |

**Your choice**:
- [ ] Do all quick wins before merge
- [ ] Create issues for later
- [ ] Skip (not needed)

---

### 📋 Suggested GitHub Issues

| # | Title | Labels | From |
|---|-------|--------|------|
| 1 | {issue title} | `enhancement`, `docs` | NOT Building |
| 2 | {issue title} | `bug`, `low-priority` | Review finding |

**Your choice**:
- [ ] Create all issues
- [ ] Create selected: {numbers}
- [ ] Skip issue creation

---

### 📝 Documentation Gaps

| File | Section | Update Needed |
|------|---------|---------------|
| CLAUDE.md | Database Schema | Add ended_reason column |
| docs/architecture.md | Sessions | Update deactivateSession signature |

**Your choice**:
- [ ] Send docs agent to fix all
- [ ] Fix manually after merge
- [ ] Skip (acceptable as-is)

---

### ⚠️ Deferred Items (from NOT Building)

| Item | Why Deferred | When to Address |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| {item} | {rationale} | {next sprint / never / if needed} |

**These were intentionally excluded** - no action needed unless priorities change.
```

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Decision matrix structured
- [ ] Quick wins identified
- [ ] Issues drafted
- [ ] Docs gaps listed

---

## Phase 4: POST - GitHub PR Comment

### 4.1 Format for GitHub

## Phase 5.5: ARCHIVE - Create Backward-Compatible Symlink

### 5.5.1 Create Symlink for PR-Based Lookup

Create symlink for backward compatibility with PR-based artifact lookup:

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(cat .archon/artifacts/runs/$WORKFLOW_ID/.pr-number 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  mkdir -p .archon/artifacts/reviews
  ln -sfn ../runs/$WORKFLOW_ID/review .archon/artifacts/reviews/pr-$PR_NUMBER
fi
```

This allows legacy tools to find review artifacts at `.archon/artifacts/reviews/pr-{number}/`.

**PHASE_5.5_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Symlink created (if PR number available)

---

## Phase 6: OUTPUT - Report to User

```markdown
