# Archon Chat Interface — End-to-End User Journey

## User Persona

**Sam** is a CTO who manages multiple projects across different domains — enterprise products
for their company (Datacore), personal side projects, and educational apps for their kids.
Sam uses Archon to organize knowledge, track tasks, and coordinate work across projects.
Sam wants the new chat interface to help them prioritize, brainstorm, and discover synergies
between projects — all through natural conversation.

Sam works on a single machine (**WIN-AI-PC** running WSL2) with Archon deployed locally.

## Journey Overview

This journey tests every capability of the Archon Chat Interface across five phases:

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|

| Phase 2 | First-time experience — Onboarding, profile setup, first conversation |
| Phase 3 | Core chat — Sidebar, full page, conversations, streaming, tools |
| Phase 4 | Advanced features — Prioritization, synergy, action mode, project-scoped chat |
| Phase 5 | Settings, search, and edge cases |
