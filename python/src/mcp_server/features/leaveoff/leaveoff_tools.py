        """Manage the LeaveOff Point for a project. A LeaveOff Point captures where work
        was left off so the next session can resume seamlessly.

        IMPORTANT: This tool should be called during session termination (when the user
        says goodbye, ends the conversation, or wraps up work). Follow the 90% rule:
        once approximately 90% of the session context window has been consumed, proactively
        write a LeaveOff Point before the context is lost.

        Each project has exactly one LeaveOff Point that is overwritten on each update.

        Args:
            action: One of "update", "get", or "delete".
                - "update": Create or overwrite the LeaveOff Point. Requires content and next_steps.
                - "get": Retrieve the current LeaveOff Point for the project.
                - "delete": Remove the LeaveOff Point for the project.
            project_id: The Archon project ID.
            content: (update only) Summary of current work state and what was accomplished.
            next_steps: (update only) Ordered list of actionable next steps for the next session.
            component: (update only) The component or area of the codebase being worked on.
            references: (update only) List of relevant file paths, URLs, or identifiers.
            machine_id: (update only) Identifier for the machine where work was performed.
            last_session_id: (update only) The session ID from the ending session.
            metadata: (update only) Additional key-value data for context.
            project_path: (update only) Filesystem path to the project repository.
