This page covers Archon's security model: how AI permissions work, how platform access is controlled, how webhooks are verified, and what data is and is not logged.

## Permission Model

Archon runs the Claude Code SDK in `bypassPermissions` mode. This means the AI agent can read, write, and execute files without interactive confirmation prompts.

**Why this is used:**
- Archon is designed for automated, unattended workflows triggered from Slack, Telegram, GitHub, and other platforms where there is no human at a terminal to approve each action.
- Requiring interactive permission prompts would block every workflow and make remote operation impossible.

**What this means in practice:**
- The AI assistant has full read/write access to the working directory (the cloned repository or worktree).
- It can run shell commands, modify files, and use all tools available to the Claude Code SDK.
- There is no per-action confirmation step.

**Mitigations:**
- Each conversation runs in an isolated git worktree by default, limiting the blast radius of any changes.
- Workflows support per-node tool restrictions (see below) to constrain what the AI can do at each step.
- The system is designed as a single-developer tool -- there is no multi-tenant isolation.

:::caution
Because `bypassPermissions` grants full file and shell access, only run Archon in environments where the AI agent is trusted with the repository contents. Do not expose Archon to untrusted users without adapter-level authorization (see below).

## Tool Restrictions

Workflow nodes support `allowed_tools` and `denied_tools` to restrict which tools the AI can use at each step. This is useful for creating sandboxed steps that can only read code (not modify it) or preventing specific tool usage.

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: review
    prompt: "Review the code for security issues"
    allowed_tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]  # Can only read, not write

  - id: implement
    prompt: "Fix the issues found"
    denied_tools: [WebSearch, WebFetch]  # No internet access
```

**How it works:**
- `allowed_tools` is a whitelist -- only listed tools are available. An empty list (`[]`) disables all tools.
- `denied_tools` is a blacklist -- listed tools are blocked, all others are available.
- These are mutually exclusive per node. If both are set, `allowed_tools` takes precedence.
- Tool restrictions are currently supported for the Claude provider only. Codex nodes with `denied_tools` will log a warning; `allowed_tools` is not supported by the Codex SDK.

## Data Privacy and Logging

Archon uses structured logging (Pino) with explicit rules about what is and is not recorded.

**Never logged:**
- API keys or tokens (masked to first 8 characters + `...` when referenced)
- User message content (the text users send to the AI)
- Personally identifiable information (PII)

**Logged (with context):**
- Conversation IDs, session IDs, workflow run IDs
- Event names (e.g., `session.create_started`, `workflow.step_completed`)
- Error messages and types (for debugging)
- Unauthorized access attempts (with masked user IDs, e.g., `abc***`)

**Log levels:**
- Default: `info` (operational events only)
- Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for detailed execution traces
- CLI: `--quiet` (errors only) or `--verbose` (debug)

## Adapter Authorization

Each platform adapter supports an optional user whitelist via environment variables. When a whitelist is configured, only listed users can interact with the bot. When the whitelist is empty or unset, the adapter operates in open access mode.

| Platform | Whitelist Variable | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slack | `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Comma-separated Slack user IDs (e.g., `U01ABC,U02DEF`) |
| Telegram | `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs |
| Discord | `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Comma-separated Discord user IDs |
| GitHub | `GITHUB_ALLOWED_USERS` | Comma-separated GitHub usernames (case-insensitive) |
| Gitea | `GITEA_ALLOWED_USERS` | Comma-separated Gitea usernames (case-insensitive) |

**Authorization behavior:**
- Whitelist is parsed once at adapter startup (from the environment variable).
- Every incoming message or webhook is checked before processing.
- Unauthorized users are silently rejected -- no error response is sent back.
- Unauthorized attempts are logged with masked user identifiers for auditing.
- The Web UI has no built-in user authentication. Use `CADDY_BASIC_AUTH` or form auth when exposing it publicly (see [Docker / Deployment](/reference/configuration/#docker--deployment) variables).

## Webhook Security

The GitHub and Gitea adapters verify webhook signatures to ensure payloads originate from the configured platform and have not been tampered with.

**GitHub:**
- Uses the `X-Hub-Signature-256` header
- HMAC SHA-256 computed over the raw request body using `WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Timing-safe comparison prevents timing attacks
- Invalid signatures are rejected and logged

**Gitea:**
- Uses the `X-Gitea-Signature` header (raw hex, no `sha256=` prefix)
- Same HMAC SHA-256 verification and timing-safe comparison
- Invalid signatures are rejected and logged

**Setup:**
1. Generate a random secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`
2. Set it in both the platform webhook configuration and Archon's environment (`WEBHOOK_SECRET` for GitHub, `GITEA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for Gitea)
3. The secrets must match exactly

## Secrets Handling

**Environment files:**
- All secrets (API keys, tokens, webhook secrets) belong in `.env` files, never in source control.
- The `.env.example` file in the repository contains placeholder values -- copy it and fill in real values.
- Never commit `.env` files to git. The repository's `.gitignore` excludes them.

**CWD `.env` isolation:**
- When running inside a target repository, Bun auto-loads that repo's `.env` before any Archon code runs. Both the CLI and server strip every key parsed from the CWD `.env` at startup, then load only `~/.archon/.env` (which always wins via `override: true`). This prevents target-repo secrets (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) from bleeding into Archon or its subprocesses.
- Claude Code subprocesses receive only an explicit allowlist of env vars (system essentials, Claude auth, Archon runtime config, git identity, GitHub tokens). Per-codebase env vars configured via `codebase_env_vars` or `.archon/config.yaml` `env:` are merged on top of this filtered base.

### Env-leak gate (target repo `.env` keys)

Archon scrubs its own environment, but **Bun auto-loads `.env` from the subprocess working directory** before any user code runs. That means a Claude or Codex subprocess started with `cwd=/path/to/target/repo` will re-inject any sensitive keys present in that repo's auto-loaded `.env` files — bypassing the allowlist above and silently billing the wrong API account.

**What Archon scans:** auto-loaded filenames `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`, `.env.development.local`, `.env.production.local`.

**Scanned keys:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

:::caution
Renaming the file to `.env.local`, `.env.development`, etc. **does not work** — Bun auto-loads those too. Only `.env.secrets` (or any non-auto-loaded name) is safe.
:::

**Where the gate runs:**

| Failure point | When | What you see |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registration (Web UI) | Adding a project via Settings → Add Project | 422 with the "Allow env keys" checkbox shown inline |
| Registration (CLI) | First `archon workflow run --cwd <repo>` auto-registers | Error message points at `--allow-env-keys` and the global config flag |
| Pre-spawn | Existing codebase, before each Claude/Codex query | Error message points at Settings → Projects → "Allow env keys" toggle |

**Primary remediation (recommended):**
1. Remove the key from the target repo's `.env`, or
2. Rename the file to `.env.secrets` and load it explicitly from your app code.

**Secondary remediation (consent grants):**
- **Web UI:** Settings → Projects → click "Allow env keys" on the row. Revoke from the same place. Each grant/revoke writes a `warn`-level audit log (`env_leak_consent_granted` / `env_leak_consent_revoked`) including `codebaseId`, `path`, scanned `files`, matched `keys`, `scanStatus` (`'ok'` or `'skipped'`), and `actor`.
- **CLI:** `archon workflow run <name> "your message" --cwd <repo> --allow-env-keys` grants consent during this run's auto-registration. The grant is persisted (the codebase row is created with `allow_env_keys = true`) and logged as `env_leak_consent_granted` with `actor: 'user-cli'`.
- **Global bypass:** set `allow_target_repo_keys: true` in `~/.archon/config.yaml` to disable the gate for all codebases on this machine. `env_leak_gate_disabled` is logged at most once per process per source (global vs. repo) the first time `loadConfig` resolves the bypass as active. A repo-level `.archon/config.yaml` with `allow_target_repo_keys: false` re-enables the gate for that repo.

**Startup scan:** When `allow_target_repo_keys` is not set, the server scans every registered codebase with `allow_env_keys = false` and emits one `startup_env_leak_gate_will_block` warning per codebase **that has findings** (i.e. would actually be blocked). This gives you a chance to grant consent before hitting a fatal error mid-workflow. The scan is skipped entirely when the global bypass is active.

**CORS:**
- API routes use `WEB_UI_ORIGIN` to restrict CORS. The default is `*` (allow all), which is appropriate for local single-developer use. Set a specific origin when exposing the server publicly.

**Docker deployments:**
- `CLAUDE_USE_GLOBAL_AUTH=true` does not work in Docker (no local `claude` CLI). Provide `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `CLAUDE_API_KEY` explicitly.
- Escape `$` as `$$` in Docker Compose `.env` files to prevent variable substitution of bcrypt hashes.
